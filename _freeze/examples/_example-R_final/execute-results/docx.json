Here is a link to the\ndetailed materials and methods if you actually want\nto replicate the stuff and things: https://protocols.io.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Temperature and ozone level.](_example-R_final_files/figure-docx/fig-airquality-1.png){#fig-airquality}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBlah, blah, blah, something important. Don't believe me? Check out @fig-airquality!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nQuarto is awesome!\n",
