## Introdution

This paper will make an important impact in a specific field of science, 
despite having "negative" results.

The aims of this paper are:

- something important
- some other important things
- maybe a few less important things

{{< includes _matmet.qmd >}}

## Results

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

Blah, blah, blah, something important. Don't believe me? Check out @fig-airquality!

## Conclusion

Quarto is awesome!
