## Introdution

This paper will make an important impact in a specific field of science, 
despite having "negative" results.

The aims of this paper are:

- something important
- some other important things
- maybe a few less important things

{{< includes _matmet.qmd >}}

## Results

```{{python}}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Blah, blah, blah, something important. Don't believe me? Check out @fig-polar!
